## What can it do ?

On the front page, the app loads and displays the most popular movies in sets of 20 per page. Users can click on a movie to open a new window showing detailed information such as the poster, description, runtime, genres, release date, and a link to its IMDb page. Additionally, a search bar allows users to look for specific movies, generating a results page similar in layout to the front page but filtered based on the search query.

## Why did i do it ?

It was a school project where we had the freedom to choose any subject. I decided to focus on filmmaking because of my passion for it, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

## Am i planning to add new features ?

Yes, Iâ€™m already planning to add a genre-based search option and improve the overall design of the pages to enhance the user experience.
